# wolf-Pack-Optimization-
wolf Pack Optimization (WPO) it is a computer optimization algorithim that uses wolf hunting technique for determining the best routes in simple dimensions.


FURTHER DESCRIPTION

The code implements the Wolf Pack Optimization (WPO) algorithm. This algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of wolf packs and it is used to solve optimization problems. The main idea behind this algorithm is to simulate the hunting behavior of a wolf pack, in which the wolves work together to locate and capture prey.

The implementation of the WPO algorithm in Python starts with the definition of the fitness function to be optimized. In this example, the fitness function is defined as the sum of the squared elements of an input vector. This function takes as input a vector x and returns a scalar value that represents the fitness or quality of the input solution.

The next step is to define the WPO algorithm itself. This function takes as input the fitness function, the dimensionality of the search space, the lower and upper bounds of the search space, the number of wolves, and the maximum number of iterations. The algorithm starts by initializing the position of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves, which represent the best, second-best, and third-best solutions found so far, respectively. These positions are initially set to zero.

The algorithm then generates an initial population of wolves with random positions in the search space. The main loop of the algorithm starts by updating the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves using a rule based on their fitness scores. The positions of the other wolves are then updated using a combination of the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves. This step simulates the hunting behavior of the wolves, in which they coordinate their movements to locate and capture prey.

The positions of the other wolves are updated using a combination of the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves. This step simulates the hunting behavior of the wolves, in which they coordinate their movements to locate and capture prey. The new positions are calculated by taking a weighted average of three solutions, which are calculated using a combination of the positions of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.

The algorithm continues to update the positions of the wolves for a maximum number of iterations. Once the loop is complete, the algorithm returns the best solution found, represented by the position of the alpha wolf, and its fitness score.

Finally, the main function is called with some example parameters. The solution and fitness score of the algorithm are printed to the console. You can modify the fitness function and other parameters to solve different optimization problems using the WPO algorithm.
